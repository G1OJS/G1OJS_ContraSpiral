After building the two turn helix described in [W6NBC's paper in QST](https://w6nbc.com/articles/2011-06QST2mhelices.pdf), I decided to build a pair of helixes, closely stacked with opposite 'sense' to cancel the residual vertical polarisation of the single helix and force it to be a wholely horizontally polarised antenna (with more gain too!).

This is a very compact antenna, with 0 dBd in all compass directions, and fits inside the non-functional decorative GRP chimney pot on my house (i.e. right at the top in the circular pot, not the square section below the pot).
